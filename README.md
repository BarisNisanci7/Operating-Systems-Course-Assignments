# Operating Systems Course Assignments

This repository contains assignments completed during my coding lab for the operating systems course. Each assignment is implemented in C and focuses on various concepts in operating systems.

## List of Assignments

1. dining_philosophers.c
2. disk_scheduling.c
3. drainer_filler.c
4. lru_page_replacement.c
5. memory_allocation_algorithms.c
6. multi_threaded_decryption.c
7. office_problem.c
8. paging_with_tlb.c
9. process_tree.c
10. producer_consumer.c
11. round-robin.c
12. sleeping-barber.c

Each assignment challenges different aspects of operating systems, such as concurrency, memory management, scheduling algorithms, and synchronization.

### Development Environment

All assignments are developed and tested using Linux as the primary operating system. Here are the reasons for choosing Linux as the development environment:

- **Compatibility:** Linux provides robust support for C programming and system-level operations, making it ideal for implementing and testing operating systems concepts.
  
- **Tools Availability:** Linux distributions come with a wide range of development tools, compilers (like GCC), and utilities that are essential for programming in C and working with system-level concepts.
  
- **Real-world Relevance:** Many production environments and servers run on Linux, so developing assignments on Linux helps in understanding real-world scenarios and deployment considerations.

Feel free to explore each assignment to understand how these concepts are implemented in C programming language within a Linux environment.
